**Live Demo:** [NLP-to-SQL Conversion Web App](http://parabrutik560.pythonanywhere.com/)

## Description

The NLP-to-SQL Conversion Web App is a powerful tool that utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 model to convert natural language queries into SQL queries. This user-friendly web application is designed to make querying databases more accessible to users with minimal SQL knowledge.

With this app, you can simply enter your natural language query and upload a CSV file containing the relevant data. The application then employs GPT-3's language processing capabilities to generate the corresponding SQL query. It executes the generated SQL query on an in-memory SQLite database created from the uploaded CSV data.

## Features

- Convert Natural Language to SQL: Transform complex natural language queries into SQL commands using the latest AI technology.
- Execute SQL Queries: The app executes the generated SQL query on the in-memory SQLite database and presents the results in a user-friendly HTML table.
- User-Friendly Interface: The intuitive web interface allows users to interact seamlessly with the application.

## How to Use

1. Access the live demo of the web app: [NLP-to-SQL Conversion Web App](http://parabrutik560.pythonanywhere.com/)

2. Enter Your Query: In the text input box, type your natural language query. For example, "Show all customers who made a purchase in the last month."

3. Upload CSV File: Select and upload a CSV file containing the data you want to query. Ensure that the CSV file is correctly formatted.

4. Convert and Execute: Click the "Convert" button to initiate the NLP-to-SQL conversion process.

5. View Results: The app will display the generated SQL query and execute it on the uploaded data. The results will be presented as an interactive HTML table, making it easy to explore the data.
